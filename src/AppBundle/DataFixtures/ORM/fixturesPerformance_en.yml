    title: Misanthrope

However, modern critic doesn’t find information on setting "Misanthrope" on Ukrainian stage and theater performance in Cherkasy thus can be a pioneer in Ukraine. This is beyond that skilful Ukrainian translation was published in 1931 by the classic Maxim Rilskyi. First of all - this is a farce about courtship of four gentlemen to one of the most outstanding beauties of high society. So, of course, we are talking about love. However, in the center of the plot turns man, organically incapable of lies and hypocrisy, what sometimes is so essential in human communication (especially in the so-called "higher circles"). In this lays undying, timeless relevance of Misanthrope. Moliere is the author of the highest cohort playwrights of all time. His perfect construction of dramatic collisions was so self-sufficient that it did not need help of his famous contemporary and favorite of the Sun King Louis XIV-th - composer Jean-Baptiste Lully. We can not afford to refuse to play in great dedication of friendship, stunning all-consuming passion of love, ups and downs in a desperate competition - sounded live music, which underlined and emphasized so cute and exciting feelings ...

    title: Hero Periwinkle
    type: Electro-Musical
    description: Bogdan Chalyi, music by Olena Belkina, electro-musical. Proven by time and generations Ukrainian author's tale (or real graphic novel, series!) by Bogdan Chalyi and artists Kira and Victor Hryhoryev, awarded in 1974 by the international prize n.a. Hans Christian Andersen, is put on the theatrical stage in the genre of epic musical for children and parents. The play is recommended for family viewing as it is riddled with sincerity and love for native land, the tale of hardening strength and faith in victory of flower boy Periwinkle who fearlessly enters the fight with a whole army of enemies. The courage and intelligence help him defeat the enemies without losing life values. The tale of hero Periwinkle has not lost its relevance for the public and political significance. With the immortal idea and ​​morality the play aims both in the present and in the future. Flight to Vyriy, battle with predatory eagles, meeting with the natives and the victory over the evil forces - call to the imagination by songs accompanied by orchestra and compositions of DJ, who himself dreams of a long journey and loyal friends.
